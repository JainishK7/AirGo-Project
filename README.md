# AirGo-Project
This my AirGo Project for Web Technology

🚀 Features
Multi-role: Flights, Hotels & Cars searchable and bookable with dynamic price/option displays.

Elegant, user-friendly forms with real-time client-side validation and error highlighting.

Custom modal popup for registration errors — always shows all mistakes at once.

Responsive Bootstrap UI; works on all screen sizes.

All major forms (including Register) work fully without a backend.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Clone or download this repo on your local machine or server.

Open the client/ folder and open any page in your browser (index.html recommended as a starting point).

All workflow is client-side — no server setup is needed for basic demonstration/development.

Use modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) for best compatibility.

✨ How to Use
Browse to /client/register.html to view or test the registration page.

Fill (or leave blank) form fields and submit; all active validation errors will appear in an animated, themed popup modal.

Once completed correctly, you will see a success message and be redirected to the login page.

Booking UIs for flights, hotels, and cars follow the same robust validation patterns.

📝 File Notes
register.html uses a standalone modal error popup and only needs register.css and register-validation.js. Do not include registration CSS in your main style.css to avoid style conflicts.

register-validation.js does real-time field restriction (alpha-only names, phone numeric, etc.) and provides full feedback on submission.

All form validation is entirely on the client for demo and coursework purposes.

🙋‍♂️ Customization & Extension
You can adapt the validation logic, add more fields, or integrate a real backend as required.

Feel free to attach screenshots of the UI or error popups in this README for documentation or demo submissions.
